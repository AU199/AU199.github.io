        WHAT IS THE PROBLEM
    </div>
    <div class="container">
        <div class="body_text" style="text-align: left;">
            In 2016, to prevent the negative effects of climate change, the Paris Agreement agreed upon the goal of attaining a temperature only 1.5 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial times (1850-1900) by 2050. However, based on current advancements, the world is far off from this goal: it is projected to reach 1.7, even 1.8, Celsius by 2050. To avoid catastrophe and extensive damage, a solution must be found quickly.

        WHAT CAN YOU DO?

            Well there are multiple ways you can help, and these can fit into your daily habits and life.
            These can be as simple using the public transport, to being as complex as going of the grid, and starting your own farm (which I don't really recommend doing).
            Though all of these don't promote change, the main thing that is required is advocating for climate change. 
            This could be as small as trying to talk to someone about it, or as big as creating a petition, and any act counts, so go out and be the change you want to see.
            The form down below is to show how driving produces great amounts of carbon dioxide, and how if mulitpule cars do the same, it can lead to an exponetical growth in the global levels.
