        WHAT IS THE PROBLEM
    </div>
    <div class="container">
        <div class="body_text" style="text-align: left;">
            In 2016, to prevent the negative effects of climate change, the Paris Agreement agreed upon the goal of attaining a temperature only 1.5 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial times (1850-1900) by 2050. However, based on current advancements, the world is far off from this goal: it is projected to reach 1.7, even 1.8, Celsius by 2050. To avoid catastrophe and extensive damage, a solution must be found quickly.

        WHAT CAN YOU DO?

            Well there are multiple ways you can help, and these can fit into your daily habits and life.
            These can be as simple using the public transport, to being as complex as going of the grid, and starting your own farm (which I don't really recommend doing).
